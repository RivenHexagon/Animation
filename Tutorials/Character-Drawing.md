* Draw a **page** of **circles**
    * **Draw** 'em **swift** and **losely**
    * **Thrive** for drawing **good** ones but **not** slowly or **cramped**
    * Put **circles in** the **circles**

    * **Good** ellipses are **mirrowed** at the **minor axis**
    * **Vary** the **width** of the ellipsis (degree of a circle's rotation)
    * The **minor axis** allways points to a **vanishing point** in perspective
    * **Check** ellipses **accuracy** after a **full page** (draw axis, tick 'em)
