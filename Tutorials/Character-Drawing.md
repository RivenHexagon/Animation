14 Lectures, 1h 34 min

### 16. Drawing Warmup and Penmanship
* Do it **every day**
* The whole **exercise** takes about **5 min**
* **Lock** your **wrist** and **draw** with **arm** and **elbow**
* **Circles** exercise of **one page**
    * **Draw** 'em **swift** and **losely**
    * **Thrive** for drawing **good** ones but **not** slowly or **cramped**
    * Put **circles in** the **circles**
* **Ellipses** exercise of **one page** (circles in perspective)
    * **Good** ellipses are **mirrowed** at the **minor axis**
    * **Vary** the **width** of the ellipsis (degree of a circle's rotation)
    * The **minor axis** allways points to a **vanishing point** in perspective
    * **Check** ellipses **accuracy** after a **full page** (draw axis, tick 'em)
* **Lines** exercise of **2-3 pages**, draw **straight** and **parallel**
    * Draw 'em **top to bottom** and **bottom to top**
* **Point to point** exercise of one **page**
    * Draw a bunch of **dots**. First **ghost**, then **draw** straight **lines** that **connects** 'em
    * **Rotate** the **page** (digitally or physically) if desired

### 17. Drawing in 3D
* Shape - Kontur, Umriss
* Form - Form (im Raum)
* Draw 3D trough **forms**, like **cylinders** (2 ellipses and 2 lines) or **boxes**
* Draw **all sides** of a basic form, including the **hidden** ones
* **Imagine** the objects **in 3D** when you **draw** 'em.
* Move away from an 2D idea of drawing
* We do **not** want **direct** front or side **views** in art
* Build **forms** from simple **shapes** and refine into **detail**
* Feel the form and support it with conture lines
* Imagine the **volume** of a form
