## Section 3: Drawing Fundamentals
14 Lectures, 1h 34 min

### 16. Drawing Warmup and Penmanship
* Do it **every day**.
* The whole **exercise** takes about **5 min**.
* **Lock** your **wrist** and **draw** with **arm** and **elbow**.
* **Circles** exercise of **one page**
    * **Draw** 'em **swift** and **losely**.
    * **Thrive** for drawing **good** ones but **not** slowly or **cramped**.
    * Put **circles in** the **circles**.
* **Ellipses** exercise of **one page** (circles in perspective)
    * **Good** ellipses are **mirrowed** at the **minor axis**.
    * **Vary** the **width** of the ellipsis (degree of a circle's rotation).
    * The **minor axis** allways points to a **vanishing point** in perspective.
    * **Check** ellipses **accuracy** after a **full page** (draw axis, tick 'em).
* **Lines** exercise of **2-3 pages**, draw **straight** and **parallel**
    * Draw 'em **top to bottom** and **bottom to top**.
* **Point to point** exercise of one **page**
    * Draw a bunch of **dots**. First **ghost**, then **draw** straight **lines** that **connects** 'em.
    * **Rotate** the **page** (digitally or physically) if desired.

### 17. Drawing in 3D
* Shape - Kontur, Umriss
* Form - Form (im Raum)
* Draw 3D trough **forms**, like **cylinders** (2 ellipses and 2 lines) or **boxes**.
* Draw **all sides** of a basic form, including the **hidden** ones.
* **Imagine** the objects **in 3D** when you **draw** 'em.
* Move away from an 2D idea of drawing.
* We do **not** want **direct** front or side **views** in art.
* Build **forms** from simple **shapes** and refine into **detail**.
* Feel the form and support it with conture lines.
* Imagine the **volume** of a form.

### 18. Dynamic Drawing
* **Looseness** is about **physicality** (your arm).
    * **Loose** lines for e.g. have a sense of **directionality**.
    * Loose, **fast** drawn lines are **smooth** and **tapered**.
    * Draw with your **arms** for the **bigger** shapes, but with your **wrist** for the **smaller** ones.
* **Dynamism** is about **movement** and **flow** in **shapes**.
    * Triangle example - **static** and in **flow**. *(t = 5:10)*
    * Dynamic shapes seem **alive**, moving or formed by **energy**, for e.g. human and animal **bodies** or **trees** and even **hills** and mountains.

### 19, Showing Depth in your Drawings
* **Overlaps** create **depth** and should be preferred over **tangents**.

### 20. Asymmentry in Drawings
* **Converging** but **asymmentrical** lines show more **dynamic**.
* **Parallels** or **mirroring** often looks too balanced and engineered.
* Parallels in **literal**, **mirroring** and **symbolic** terms. *(t = 2:00)*
* **Avoid parallels** at all times *(t = 2:50)*.
* An **odd number** of buttons on a shirt are better than an even count.
* We want **asymmentrical** shapes in **everything**.

### 21. Drawing Line Weights
* **Atmospheric Perspective** can be achieved through line weights (**faint** or **thin** lines lines in the **distance**).
* We can achieve a 3D look by
    * drawing the **hidden** edges.
    * **overlapping** objects.
* **Weighting** lines **enhances** overlapses.
* We can **darken** the **origin** of the background **lines** to hint a **shadow**. *(t = 4:10)*
* Keep **inner details** at **thinner** lines.
* See Orc character **example** *(t = 5:30)*

### 22. Drawing Thinly and Lightly
* In **general** lean towards **lighter** and **thinner** lines.
* Can make a line **thicker easily**, but not thinner.
* Can make **corrections** by pressing **harder** on top.
* **Remember** this lesson!

### 23. The Importance of Drawing Fast
* **Not** drawing fast can be **relatet** to
    * not beeing **lose**
    * **fear** of how and what to draw
* As **fast** and **accurate** at the same time. *(t = 1:00)*
* **Speed** means **looseness** that has a **natural** look.
* **Faster** drawing -> **more** drawings -> quicker **progress**

### 24. Two Stage Drawing Workflow
* **Stage One**: the **Rough**
    * solid **foundation**
    * bulk of **theory**
    * **planing** phase
    * very **loose** and **care-free** *(t = 2:40)*
    * it's **ugly** like a **construction site**
* **Stage Two**: the **Refined**
    * **professionalism**
    * **clean**
    * good **presentation**
    * makes work look **pretty**
    * **free** and **most creative** stage
    * do the **decorative** stuff
* The **utmost** is **build** in the **rough**, but it takes only **20%** of the **time**! *(t = 5:30)*
* It's the **80/20 Rule** of rough and refined.
* See Elve character **example** *(t = 6:00)*
    * The **structure** is right
    * The **details** go easily **on top**
    * final **line weight** is applied
* The **global workflow** consists of
    * **Rough** stage (contains almost all the theory)
        * **Shape** (gesture, character composition, etc.)
        * **Form** (anatomy, structure, etc.)
        * **Details**
    * **Refined** stage
* You can **easily** finnish up a **fundamentally strong** rough
